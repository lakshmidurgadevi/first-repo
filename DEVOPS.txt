 DEVOPS 

devops = development + operations 
. developers (who write code) 
. operations (who deploy/manage system) 
work together, instead of working in silos.

real time example :  imagine developing a mobile app like Swiggy.
1. the developer writes code to add "track my order" feature.
2. without devops: developer gives code to ops team --- they manually deploy --- bugs happen --- delay.
3. with devops: code is automatically tested and deployed -- customers get update faster and safely.

devops helps :
1. release features faster.
2. fix bugs quickly.
3. automate repetitive tasks.


PHASES                          DESCRIPTION

PLAN                           Define what to build

develop                        write the code

build                          compile code into deployable format

test                           check for bugs automatically

release                        approve the build for deployment

deploy                         push app to servers or app store

operate                        keep app running.fix any issues

monitor                        analyze performance and feedback




DEVOPs VISUALIZATION:
devops involves multiple stages--like plan , develop etc
using diagram.net helps students see the full flow clearly, instead of just reading theory.
